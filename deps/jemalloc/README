jemalloc 是 redis 内存分配策略的方案之一，除此之外还有 tcmalloc 和苹果系统
的内存分配策略。decode-redis-2.8 不对 jemalloc  做深入的解读。

jemalloc is a general-purpose scalable concurrent malloc(3) implementation.
This distribution is a "portable" implementation that currently targets
FreeBSD, Linux, Apple OS X, and MinGW.  jemalloc is included as the default
allocator in the FreeBSD and NetBSD operating systems, and it is used by the
Mozilla Firefox web browser on Microsoft Windows-related platforms.  Depending
on your needs, one of the other divergent versions may suit your needs better
than this distribution.

The COPYING file contains copyright and licensing information.

The INSTALL file contains information on how to configure, build, and install
jemalloc.

The ChangeLog file contains a brief summary of changes for each release.
